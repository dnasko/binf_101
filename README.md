# Bioinformatics Coding 101

Welcome! You're here because you either need to learn how to use the command line, or would like to know more about a particular computational resource you're working with.

### Where am I?

You're reading the README.md file on this Git repository. Don't worry, if none of that makes sense now, it will soon.

### Where do I go from here?

Well, if it's your first time here, you'll want to click on the [lectures folder](https://github.com/dnasko/binf_101/tree/master/lectures) above. This folder contains all of the lecture-style notes on various topics you'll find useful when getting started in bioinformatics.

### Notes

This repository initially started as a collection of scripts and datasets to supplement teaching someone to code well enough to get by in bioinformatics. It has since evolved into a more structured set of tutorials for people with no BASH experience to pick up and play with.
