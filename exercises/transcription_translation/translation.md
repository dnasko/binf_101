### Translation

Transcription is a relatively easy process to code. I mean, after all, we're just translating `/ATGC/UACG/`. [Translation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation_(biology)) on the other hand requires a bit more coding savy. Remember, [there's more than one way to code anything](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There%27s_more_than_one_way_to_do_it), but some ways are better than others. So when it comes to translating DNA to proteins you should really be using a [dictionary](https://www.python-course.eu/dictionaries.php).

So take a look back at the [codon table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_codon_table) and think of how you can read this into a dictionary to translate a DNA sequence into a protein.

**Task:** Write a script that translates a DNA FASTA files into a peptide FASTA file.

**Output:** A peptide FASTA file.
