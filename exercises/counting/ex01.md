### Exercise 01

You'll always want some high-level description of a FASTA/Q file, like: how many sequences are there? What's the largest one, etc...

Write a script that calculates the following from a FASTA file:

1. Count how many sequences are in the file
2. Count how many bases are in the file
3. Calculate the average sequence size
4. Calculate the N50 sequence size (the sequence size where the total bases contained in *larger* sequences equals the total bases contained in *smaller* sequences)
5. Calculate the standard deviation of sequence sizes
6. Tell us how big the largest sequence was

Pretty straight forward stuff and I think it’s a good starting point for you. If you’re struggling with some of this, that’s fine. The best way to learn is to struggle and continue to try tweaking your code, Googling solutions, and trying again.
