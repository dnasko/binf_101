### You're reading a Markdown file. Why?

As they say in the [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown), Markdown is a lightweight markup language (Markup? the "M" in HTML) with plain text formatting syntax. The important bit is that it's designed to be converted to HTML and many other formats using a tool of the same name. Markdown is often used for writing README files (especially on GitHub!).

But why? Well, perhaps the most important aspect of coding is documentation. I think an argument can be made that a well-documented, poorly designed, script is better than one that works well but you can't figure out hwo to run it or how ti works. Each language handles code commenting and usage differently, but Markdown gives you and opertunity to write more about what your code is supposed to do and how to run it.
