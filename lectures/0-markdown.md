# You're reading a Markdown file. Why?

As they say in the [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown), Markdown is a lightweight markup language (Markup? the "M" in HTML) with plain text formatting syntax. The important bit is that it's designed to be converted to HTML and many other formats using a tool of the same name. Markdown is often used for writing README files (especially on GitHub!).

But why? Well, perhaps the most important aspect of coding is documentation. I think an argument can be made that a well-documented, poorly designed, script is better than one that works well but you can't figure out how to run it or how it works. Each language handles code commenting and usage differently, but Markdown gives you and opertunity to write more about what your code is supposed to do and how to run it.

### Structuring Markdown files

As you can see Markdown makes it easy to structure your document in a note-taking style with section headers, but you can also add thigns like:

- Bulleted lists
- [Embedded links](philadelphiaeagles.com)
- Or `inline code`

You can also add:

1. Numbered lists
2. Tables (below)
3. Images

There are sites with far better written and detailed examples than this one though. I'd highly recommend you check out Adam Pritchard's [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) (which is also written in Markdown).

### Viewing Markdown files

Writing Markdown is easy, but viewing it can be tough for beginners. Once you push your git repository to GitHub (more on what all of that means later) Git converts the `.md` files to HTML. If you're not familiar enough with Git yet, no problem! You can try tools like [Macdown](https://macdown.uranusjr.com), which provides you a GUI to see real-time how Markdown is formatted.
