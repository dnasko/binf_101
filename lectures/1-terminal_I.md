# Terminal and Bash (part I)

If you're using a MacBook or PC running a Linux operating system, you're already off to a great start! These operating systems have a program called `Terminal` installed by default. Go ahead and open that up and head to the [file navigation section](1-terminal_I.md/#nav-sys) while I have a personal conversation with the Windows users.

### Windows Users

Well, this is awkward. Why are the fancy Mac people and nerds with Linux machines moving on and you're stuck here? I love this [tree that shows the history of Unix and Unix-like](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Unix#/media/File:Unix_history-simple.svg) systems. Machines running these OSs use a common user interface to allow users to interact with the operating system's services. This "interface" is called a shell.

So what's the problem here? Well, you don't see Windows OS on that tree, thus there's a chasm between Mac/Unix and Windows machines when it comes to command line interfaces (CLI). Don't worry though, there are a few options we have to save your poor doomed PC still.
